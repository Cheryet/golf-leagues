# Golf Leagues ⛳️ (Under Construction)

Golf leagues is a passion project in the works. It's purpose is to help golf courses manage their own independant leagues (ex: Mens League, Womens League, ect) via a web app. This will provide the golf club with a place to create a league and populate it with teams and players.

After a completed round, an Admin can input scores from a given week and have the indiviual players handicaps automatically update for the next week of play. This allows clubs to have an accurate and up to date handicap on all league players week to week creating a fair play environment for all.

This app is being built with the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js)
